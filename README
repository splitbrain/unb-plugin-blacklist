Blacklist Plugin for Unclassified Newsboard

This plugin will check each post against a list of regular expressions. If any
of them match the post will be denied and the attempt is logged.

This reuses the blacklisting mechanism of DokuWiki described here:
https://www.dokuwiki.org/blacklist

To install, copy the blacklist.* files into your unb_lib/plugins folder.
Additionally the cp_box_textarea.html file has to be copied to
unb_lib/designs/modern/tpl and you need to adjust your
unb_lib/designs/modern/tpl/controlpanel_plugins.html:

find the following (around line 92):

    {elseif eq $fieldtype "text"}
        {include "cp_box_text.html"}

and add two lines like this:

    {elseif eq $fieldtype "text"}
        {include "cp_box_text.html"}
    {elseif eq $fieldtype "textarea"}
        {include "cp_box_textarea.html"}

The settings are sotred in a blacklist-plugin.conf file at the top of your
UNB install. Make sure that's writable.
