Blacklist Plugin for Unclassified Newsboard

This plugin will check each post against a list of regular expressions. If any
of them match the post will be denied and the attempt is logged.

This reuses the blacklisting mechanism of DokuWiki described here:
https://www.dokuwiki.org/blacklist

To install, copy the blacklist.* files into your unb_lib/plugins folder.

The settings are sotred in a blacklist-plugin.conf file at the top of your
UNB install. Make sure that's writable.
